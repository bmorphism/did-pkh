<cel> hi, oed
<oed> sup
<oed> anything to do here today?
<cel> looks like not, unless you want to talk about things, other 
  contributors are unable to make this call
<cel> hi Johannes
Our Robot Overlords are scribing.
<cel> Usually Juan has been running this call, but unable to make 
  it today.
Charles E. Lehner: Did:pkh is a DID method where the DID subject 
  is a public key hash, basically.
Charles E. Lehner: Johannes: what is the motivation?
Charles E. Lehner:  A main motivation is for blockchain account 
  addresses [scribe assist by Charles E. Lehner]
Charles E. Lehner: 
  https://w3c-ccg.github.io/security-vocab/#blockchainAccountId
<cel> ... specifically, we see this in the CCG's security 
  vocabulary blockchainAccountId property
Charles E. Lehner: Johannes: how do we link blockchain account 
  addresses with DIDs and VCs?
Charles E. Lehner:  Yes, with did:pkh the blockchain account 
  address is in the DID [scribe assist by Charles E. Lehner]
Charles E. Lehner: Johannes: right. what is the use case? say i 
  have a blockchain account address, how would i use did:pkh?
Charles E. Lehner:  With did:pkh currently, you can convert a 
  blockchainAccountId value to a did:pkh DID [scribe assist by 
  Charles E. Lehner]
<cel> ... then you can issue VCs, generate VPs, sign other 
  things, using the public key that hashes to that blockchain 
  account id
Charles E. Lehner: Johannes: ok
Charles E. Lehner: Johannes: so i could share VPs, and they would 
  be linked to my blockchain account address, just like on-chain 
  assets, so like the on-chain assets would be linked to the VCs?
Charles E. Lehner:  What do you mean by on-chain assets? [scribe

Charles E. Lehner: Johannes: one of the things you could do is 
  say Johannes owns this NFT, so it would be linked...
Charles E. Lehner:  I think it's a little different because we 
  don't have an idea of transferability... [scribe assist by 
  Charles E. Lehner]
<cel> ... relevant:

  by Joe Andrieu on NFTs vs VCs
<cel> ... so if the issuer is a did:pkh, it stays that issuer, 
  and if the subject is a did:pkh it stays that subject
<cel> ... do you think this is a limitation/problem, or it's 
  useful as is?
Charles E. Lehner: Johannes: Useful as is
<cel> ... Is this call weekly?
Charles E. Lehner:  Yes, we'll try to send more agenda emails 
  [scribe assist by Charles E. Lehner]
<cel> ... Thanks for coming
Charles E. Lehner: Johannes: thanks
